__Course description:__  

Journalism is changing rapidly, and as a result, new graduates need to be competent in a variety of online journalism skills, in addition to the basics of writing and reporting. This course will focus on helping you develop proficiency in a variety of multimedia skills and knowledge to prepare you for this fast-changing environment.  

While this course will help you navigate a number of different technologies, it is first and foremost a journalism course. So the focus will be on the journalism – the reporting and the story – not on the tools. You're going to learn carpentry, not hammer.

You will learn the basics of creating online story packages: planning, pitching, reporting, editing determining the best use of multimedia and visual presentation. After taking this class, you should possess many of the online skills sought by employers, in addition to creating digital work you can showcase in your portfolio. You should be prepared to move seamlessly into the capstone course, where you will have the background and skills to create advanced multimedia story packages for publication.

__Course goals:__  

* To educate you about current practices and future frontiers of mulitmedia journalism. 
* To expose you to the tools of mulitmedia journalism.
* To master the conceptualization, production and publication of multimedia journalism through producing stories for online publication.
* To open your mind to the possibilities that online multimedia journalism contains. 

__Prerequisites:__  

* JOUR 160 (or the former JOUR 162 and JOUR 163 under the 2012 bulletin) and JOUR 202.
* You're going to do much better in this class if you've taken JOUR302 first. It's not required, but it's a really good idea.

__Required Materials:__  

* "Journalism Next" by Mark Briggs, Second Edition, ISBN: 978-1-4522-2785-6.
* "The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law" (recent edition).
* 16 GB SDHC, Class 6 or better flash memory card with a compatible compact card reader. The card and card reader are available on Amazon and most computer stores. This will be your personal memory card for audio and video recordings. Be sure the one you buy is a Class 6 or better and has a card reader.

__Assignments__ 

_Four online multimedia stories_: These assignments need to be approved by the instructor before work begins; the format for story pitches will be specified for each assignment. Each online news-feature package will include at least three multimedia storytelling elements (text, audio, audio slideshow, photos, video, informational and/or interactive graphics.) Each story must use a new element that you haven't used before.

_Final enterprise multimedia story_: You will be given several weeks to produce a story involving at least four mulitmedia elements, on a story with some depth. You will be graded in part on the ambition of your story.

_Story pitches_: In class and in writing, you will be pitching your stories to me, infront of the class, to get into the habit of conceptualizing stories in advance and refining them as you go. You will be graded on the quality of the pitches and evidence of forethought, reporting and research put into it.

_Multimedia assignments/quizzes_: Several smaller multimedia exercises related to online content, photography, video, data, mobile and graphics. These may be in‐class assignments or assignments with a longer deadline.  Some may be easy; some may be more complex.  Some may be graded; some may not.  But these will not be busy-work assignments; they will be designed to help you practice important skills.

__Grading:__  

The grading will be based on the stories you produce, the work you put into them and your participation in class. 

The bulk of the graded work in this class is as follows:

|Assignment|Percentage of your grade|
|----------|------------------------|
|Four enterprise stories|60%|
|Final project|20%|
|Pitches|10%|

__Notes on attendance:__  

Yes, we all get sick. Yes, things happen. I don’t want you to be sick in my class any more than you want to be sick. You’ve got no fewer than four ways to get ahold of me, including my cell number. If you are going to miss class, tell me before class. We’ll work it out. But you have to tell me before class for me to help you.

This said: this class builds each class onto the next one. Miss a class and you are behind. We’re going to be covering a lot of new material in this class. Miss one at your own peril.

__The short version on policies regarding academic integrity, diversity and students with disabilities:__  

You cheat, you fail, no exceptions. 

If I’m doing something that’s keeping you from learning, tell me. Tell the Dean. Tell someone, because that’s not cool. I won’t tolerate it from myself and you shouldn’t either.

Now, the longer versions:

__Academic integrity:__  

Every student must adhere to the policy on academic integrity set forth in the UNL Student Code of Conduct as outlined in the UNL Bulletin. Students who plagiarize may receive a failing grade on an assignment or for an entire course and may be reported to the Student Judicial Review Board. The work a student submits in a class must be the student's own work and must be work completed for that particular class and assignment. Students wishing to build on an old project or work on a similar project in two classes must discuss this with both professors. Academic dishonesty includes:

*  handing in another's work or part of another's work as your own.
*  turning in one of your old papers (including something you wrote in high school) for a current class.
*  turning in the same or similar paper for two different classes,
*  using notes or other study aids or otherwise obtaining another's answers for a quiz or an examination.

Anything and everything you include in your papers that comes from another source must be attributed with proper citation. That includes ideas and opinions. 
Plagiarism consists of using phrases, sentences or paragraphs from any source and republishing them without alteration or attribution. The sources include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio reports, Web sites and other students’ papers.  

__Students with disabilities:__ 

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.  

__Diversity:__  

The College of Journalism and Mass Communications values diversity, in the broadest sense of the word – gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, income, religion, education, geographic, physical and mental ability or disability, sexual orientation. We recognize that understanding and incorporating diversity in the curriculum enables us to prepare our students for careers as professional communicators in a global society. As communicators, we understand that journalism, advertising and other forms of strategic communication must reflect society in order to be effective and reliable. We fail as journalists if we are not accurate in our written, spoken and visual reports; including diverse voices and perspectives improves our accuracy and truthfulness. In advertising, we cannot succeed if we do not understand the value of or know how to create advertising that reflects a diverse society and, thus, appeals to broader audiences.

__ACEJMC Competencies:__  

The College of Journalism and Mass Communications is accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC). This course addresses the following ACEJMC competencies: *	Write correctly and clearly in forms and styles appropriate for the journalism profession, audience and purposes students serve; *	Apply tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work;*	Conduct research and evaluate information by methods appropriate to the communications professions in which they work;*	Critically evaluate their own work and that of others for accuracy and fairness, clarity, appropriate style and grammatical correctness;*	Demonstrate an understanding of professional ethical principles and work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and diversity;*	Demonstrate an understanding of the diversity of peoples and cultures and of the significance and impact of mass communications in a global society;*	Apply basic numerical and statistical concepts.

##Class Schedule:##

A word of warning: This class is pretty fluid. I will move things up and back, depending on how well you’re getting things. If things change, I will update the syllabus on Blackboard and I will update you.
